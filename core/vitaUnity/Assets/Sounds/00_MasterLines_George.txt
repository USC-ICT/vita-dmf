George_Hostile_Elaborations_2002	Can you give me more details
George_Hostile_01E	Hi. Anything you want to tell me about yourself before we get started? 
George_Hostile_02E	You may think this job is gonna be a piece of cake, but it's all about safety for us, and safety requires a lot of focus. Have you ever done a job or a project where safety and focus were important?
George_Hostile_03E	Okay, well, what you'd be doing here will be a little different from that. Let's move on. Now I need hard workers. So convince me. I want to hear about a time in which you succeeded in something because you busted your butt.
George_Hostile_04E	Why do you think you're the right person for this job?
George_Hostile_05E	So do you have any limitations that are going to affect your ability to do this job? Think really hard before you answer.
George_Hostile_06E	Anyway, maybe this question will be easier. What motivates you?
George_Hostile_07E	So why are you applying for this job?
George_Hostile_08AE	Say I give you this job. Is this a temporary thing for you? Where do you see yourself in five years?
George_Hostile_08BE	Say I go against my instincts, and I give you this job. Is this a temporary thing for you? Where do you see yourself in five years?
George_Hostile_09E	You got anything else you want to tell me before you leave?
George_Hostile_10E	I'll let you know if this is the right fit.
George_Neutral_01E	Hi. How you doing?
George_Neutral_02E	First off, it's important I say this – this job is pretty straight-forward, but safety is our biggest concern, so you'll need to be very focused. Tell me about some of the jobs or tasks you've done in the past that required a lot of focus and safety.
George_Neutral_03E	Okay, success in this job, like anything else, requires hard work. Tell me about a time you've been successful as a result of hard work in school or on the job.
George_Neutral_04E	Why do you think you're right for this job?
George_Neutral_05E	Do you have any restrictions that I should know about that might affect your ability to do this job? 
George_Neutral_06E	What gets you going in the morning? What motivates you?
George_Neutral_07E	Why do you wanna work for us?
George_Neutral_08E	What are some of your long-term goals? Are you saving up for something? Do you wanna manage staff?
George_Neutral_09E	Okay then. That's it. Anything you want to tell me before I let you go?
George_Neutral_10E	Thanks. I'll let you know what I decide.
George_Softtouch_01E	Hi. How's it going?
George_Softtouch_02E	I know this job seems pretty straight-forward, but safety is a big issue for us, so it requires a lot of focus. You look like someone who's up to the challenge, but can you tell me of a job or a task you've done that required a lot of focus and safety?
George_Softtouch_03E	I like hard workers – people who want to be successful. Tell me about a time you've been successful as a result of hard work. It can be in school or on the job.
George_Softtouch_04E	Why do you think you're right for this job?
George_Softtouch_05E	I hope it's okay if I ask this, but I like for my employees to be honest and self-aware. Are there any restrictions that might get in the way of you doing this job? 
George_Softtouch_06E	I know that was a tough question. I'm curious, what motivates you? 
George_Softtouch_07E	Tell me, why you wanna work here?
George_Softtouch_08E	What about your plans for the future? Do you have any long term goals? Maybe opening up your own business or managing other people? 
George_Softtouch_09E	Thanks for your time. Do you have any questions for me?
George_Softtouch_10E	Thanks. I'll be in touch.
