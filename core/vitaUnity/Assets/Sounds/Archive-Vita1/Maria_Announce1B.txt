Hi, I'm Maria Gonzales. Innovative thinkers at the Dan Marino Foundation and the USC Institute for Creative Technologies created me, and virtual humans like me, to help people with autism and other disabilities gain competitive employment. I'm part of a software program called Vita that uses virtual reality to simulate job interviews. Underperforming on job interviews is a big reason why 8 out of 10 people with disabilities are unemployed.
